# Changelog

All notable changes to the blindspot-audit skill and this repository.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- Claude Code plugin marketplace support: `/plugin marketplace add MJL-ren/blindspot-audit`
  (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` + `plugin.json`).
- Multilingual READMEs (English, Korean, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, Spanish)
  with a language switcher and a copy-paste "Quick AI Install" prompt.
- `build-skill-package` scripts (`.py` / `.ps1` / `.sh`) and a refreshed
  `dist/blindspot-audit.skill` for Claude desktop app users.
- `install-claude-user` scripts — Claude Code personal install
  (`~/.claude/skills`), also read by OpenCode.
- GitHub Actions CI for `dist/blindspot-audit.skill` source/package content
  consistency plus Bash and PowerShell script syntax checks.
- This changelog.

### Changed

- Merged the Claude-side audit design into the skill core: self-tracking-doc
  filter, 3-7 finding cap with mandatory trust sections, fresh-eyes external
  change scan, owner-awareness interview (`unknown_known` findings get a
  documentation prescription, not a lecture), cross-host adapters
  (Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode / chat-only, including a no-web fallback),
  and a portable inventory-script path.
- Naturalness fixes in the Japanese and Spanish READMEs.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- Initial public structure: the skill itself (`SKILL.md`, references,
  templates, project inventory script), installers for Codex and Claude Code
  project scope, MIT license, English/Korean READMEs.
